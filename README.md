These are my solutions to the AdventOfCode (https://adventofcode.com).

## Java

```
    $ cd aoc-java
    $ ant
```

## Erlang

### Other

Various other years/days are also solved, but not included in the
scripts to run easily.

## Performance

2015 solutions for Java have a total runtime of <10 s. Erlang
solutions typically average 2s per puzzle, with spikes upwards 15s.
